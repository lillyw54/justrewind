# Project 3: Just Rewind


# Description 
Hey dude! Remember the good ole days back in the late 80’s and early 90’s? Getting out of school on a Friday night? Ordering some pizza and hitting up your local Blockbuster and Hollywood Video to pick up some retro VHS movies to watch for the weekend with the homies? Streaming services have lost that magic of immersion and connectivity with your fellow dudes. How many times have you wanted to go back and watch Jim Carrey’s The Mask or Home Alone? Movies you loved as a kid but when you try to find them to stream they are either unavailable or cost way too much for a movie you can try to find an old copy in your attic instead? With Just Rewind you would be able to search the nostalgic movies you like and you would be able to post which nostalgic movies you like on your profile and to even make it better you can be able to connect and meet up with people who like the same movies as you do!
